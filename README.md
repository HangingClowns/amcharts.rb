# AmCharts.rb

Ruby on Rails wrapper for creating AmCharts charts.

## Using a Commercial license

If you have purchased the commercial version of AmCharts, place the amcharts.js file it comes with inside a
`javascripts/amcharts` directory within `(app|lib|vendor)/assets`, so that it will be used instead of the free
version that is included in this gem.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'amcharts.rb'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install amcharts.rb

## Contributing

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request
